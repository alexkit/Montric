title: What is EurekaJ Profiler ?
---

<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>

<p>EurekaJ is an Open Source, Standards based profiler tool for Java applications. This site is intended to include all documentations and information regarding the project, its use and its benefits. The EurekaJ project has a long list of features, more of which is listed on the <a href="/features.html">feature</a> page.</p>

<p>As the project started, work on a custom Javaagent was planned and started using Javassist as the bytecode library of choice. Later on, BTrace was chosen as the javaagent. BTrace has a large feature set that goes hand in hand with features planned for EurekaJ. Basing the agent on BTrace makes easier to focus the development upon the EurekaJ Manager, meaning that the feature set of the Manager application will be completed earlier.</p>
